# Fashion Recommendation System

A comprehensive personalized fashion recommendation system designed to enhance online fashion retail by providing accurate, context-aware product suggestions through advanced machine learning techniques.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**:
  - Combines Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Deep Learning-based Visual Recommendations.
- **Visual Search**:
  - Users can upload reference images to receive visually similar product recommendations.
- **Personalized Recommendations**:
  - Tailored to individual user preferences, handling diverse style variations.

### Additional Features
- Confidence scores for recommendations.
- Continuous learning mechanism to improve over time.
- A/B testing framework for optimizing strategies.

## System Architecture
- **Microservices-based Design**:
  - Scalable and modular architecture for real-time recommendation generation.
- **Low-latency Retrieval**:
  - Optimized for fast and efficient recommendations.

## Technical Overview

### 1. Recommendation Algorithms
- **Collaborative Filtering**:
  - User-user and item-item similarity calculations.
  - Matrix factorization techniques for improved accuracy.
- **Content-Based Filtering**:
  - Feature extraction from product images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  - Dense feature representations for detailed product analysis.
- **Visual Search**:
  - Image similarity matching system using advanced image processing techniques.

### 2. Data Processing and Feature Engineering
- Robust preprocessing pipeline for:
  - Visual attributes (color, pattern, style).
  - Textual metadata and brand information.
  - User interaction history.

### 3. Machine Learning Framework
- **Deep Learning**:
  - Leverage PyTorch/TensorFlow for building recommendation models.
- **Image Processing**:
  - Extract features with OpenCV and transfer learning.

### 4. Scalability and Deployment
- **Backend**:
  - Python (FastAPI/Flask).
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL with Redis caching.
- **Deployment**:
  - Containerized using Docker, scalable with Kubernetes.

## Performance Metrics
- Track and optimize:
  - Recommendation accuracy.
  - User engagement and conversion rates.
  - Computational efficiency.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Bias Detection**:
  - Ensure fairness in recommendations.
- **User Privacy**:
  - Data security and compliance with privacy standards.
- **Transparency**:
  - Explainable recommendations for user trust.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Flask)
- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch/TensorFlow
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis caching
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
