# Fashion Recommendation System

## Project Overview
Develop a comprehensive personalized fashion recommendation system that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate, context-aware product suggestions for online fashion retail.

## Core Objectives

1. Create a sophisticated recommendation engine that can:
   - Predict user fashion preferences with high accuracy
   - Handle diverse style variations
   - Provide personalized product recommendations
   - Address challenges in fashion e-commerce recommendation systems

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Recommendation Algorithms

- Implement a hybrid recommendation approach combining:
  * Collaborative Filtering
  * Content-Based Filtering
  * Deep Learning-based Visual Recommendation

### 2. Data Processing and Feature Engineering

- Develop robust data preprocessing pipeline
- Extract and vectorize product features:
  - Visual attributes (color, pattern, style)
  - Textual metadata
  - Brand information
  - User interaction history

### 3. Machine Learning Components

#### Collaborative Filtering Module

- Use matrix factorization techniques
- Implement user-user and item-item similarity calculations
- Handle cold start problem with intelligent initialization strategies

#### Content-Based Filtering Module

- Create feature extraction for product images using:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Transfer learning from pre-trained fashion recognition models
- Generate dense feature representations for products

#### Visual Search Functionality

- Develop image similarity matching system
- Allow users to upload reference images
- Return visually similar product recommendations

### 4. System Architecture

- Microservices-based design
- Scalable recommendation engine
- Real-time recommendation generation
- Low-latency recommendation retrieval

### 5. Performance Metrics

Track and optimize:
- Recommendation accuracy
- User engagement rates
